# psAvail
Lightweight PowerShell Utility for Testing Port Availability

## Description
This script was written as a little utility for assisting in managing infrastructure upgrades, to ensure that I would always be able to react immediately once a box had returned to function, to save time in such processes. 

## Usage 
Simply download the script and execute with:
```
./psAvail.ps1
```
Then follow the prompts to setup your availability test.
